The project contains a wpf application running Game of Life:
- Changable game map dimensions,
- Possibility to edit the map when the game is running,
- Save/Load the game (with all stats, settings and dimensions) to and from a savefile,
- One step at a time or run evolutions automatically,
- Possibility to reset the map,
- Possibility to start another game with other map dimensions,
